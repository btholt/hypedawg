# Hypedawg

Written for Jason Lengstorf's four dev challenge. I hacked together a VS Code quickstart and the Google Vertex AI endpoint sample code and came out with this unholy mess. Gods forgive me for what I have done with TypeScript. I'm pretty sure there's still a lot of the VS Code sample code in here.

# Running it

You should just be able to open this folder in VS Code and run "Run Extension" via the built-in VS Code debugger. You may need to run the `npm run watch` command too to compile the TypeScript, I can't remember.

You'll have to put your GCloud project ID in the getHype function. I got it from the Vertex AI code sample. You'll also likely need to run `gcloud auth application-default login` if you haven't to get the right credentials.
